    |   This tool uses Javascript to recreate bitmap/raster images from SVG gradients.
    |   Storing images in this format is ridiculously inefficient. For example, a 90kb
    |   image (png) can end up being close to 15mb in size when converted! The emblem
    |   editor will accept just over 1mb of data so this tool will not work for full
    |   resolution images. Adjustments (resizing/low colour) may be needed to get some
    |   emblems in-game.
    |   
    |   This was a fun project during a couple of covid lockdowns and was largely thrown
    |   together as I went along. I've gone through and rewritten some parts and tidied
    |   it up a bit, but it's still quite messy and there's quite a few ideas that I
    |   didn't get around to including (such as detecting actual gradients in the source
    |   image). This method could be patched pretty quickly though, so it might not be
    |   worth implementing additional features. The link in the video description will
    |   be updated if/when this tool is updated.
